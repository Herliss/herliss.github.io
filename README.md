## 🔐 Security Baseline

This project is a public MVP hosted on GitHub Pages and follows secure development best practices aligned with OWASP.

### Implemented Controls
- Public repository with no secrets or credentials stored in code
- GitHub Advanced Security enabled (free for public repos)
- Code scanning with CodeQL
- Dependency scanning and automated security updates (Dependabot)
- Secret scanning and push protection enabled
- HTTPS enforced via GitHub Pages

### Secure Development Principles
- Minimal attack surface (static site, no backend)
- No processing or storage of personal or sensitive data
- Dependencies kept to a minimum and regularly updated
- Security issues can be reported privately via GitHub

### Risk Acceptance
As an MVP, some non-critical findings may be accepted and documented, prioritizing simplicity and future scalability.
